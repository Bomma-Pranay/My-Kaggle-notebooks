# My Kaggle notebooks
This repo contains my Jupyter Notebooks (with PDFs). &lt;br/> Please refer to PDF versions instead of ipynb because in ipynb, output charts are blank (for plotly library, but for matplotlib &amp; seaborn this issue isn't there). But, if you want to download &amp; edit the notebook, you can refer to ipynb version.
